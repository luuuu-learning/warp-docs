# Jobs

Jobs are the main feature of Warp. Users submit WASM messages along with specified [conditions](#conditions), and a reward. When the conditions are met, [keepers](#keepers) send the message and recieve the reward. 

When a job is created, users must specify a job name, a reward amount, an execute message, and a contract address for the message. 

```rust
pub struct Job {
	// unique identifier for each Job
	pub id: Uint64,
	// job creator address
  pub owner: Addr,
	// UTC timestamp for when the job was submitted
  pub publish_time: Uint64,
	// name given to the Job
  pub name: String,
	// status of the job (pending, executed, failed, cancelled)
  pub status: JobStatus,
	// condition set dictating when the Job should be executed
  pub condition: Condition,
	// message to execute when conditions resolve to true
  pub msg: WasmMsg,
	// reward to distribute to the keeper when the Job has been executed
  pub reward: Uint128,
}
```

## Conditions

Each job must be submitted with conditions, or a set of circumstances under which the job should be executed. Conditions are made up of expressions which can be simple, such as specifying a blockheight, or complex, in which multiple conditions are nested and joined using boolean operators. Query responses can also be used in expressions to specify a condition. When all the expressions  in a condition evaluate to _`true`_, the condition is met, and the job can be completed. 

To learn more about how conditions work, visit the [Conditions page](../condition.mdx).

## Keepers

A keeper is any party that maintains the automation functions of a smart contract. Keepers are incentivized by Warp users to execute smart contract functions on their behalf, in exchange for a reward.
