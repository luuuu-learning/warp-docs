## Run a keeper

Running a keeper is simple. Warp provides a repository that contains the logic for a simple keeper. Follow these steps to create a keeper. 

1. Clone the repo.

2. Add your mnemonic into the _`.env`_ file.

3. Run the following commands from the cloned repository:

```sh Commands
yarn install
yarn run
```

Your keeper should be up and running. It will evaluate conditions in the queue and execute job messages whose conditions have been met. Once executed, your keeper will receive the rewards included with each job.
