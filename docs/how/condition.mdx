# Conditions and expressions

Conditions represent event definitions, and they outline the circumstances under which a job can be completed. A condition is a recursive data type that allows for multiple conditions within it, all of which need to resolve to true for the Job to allow execution. This complex data type includes several underlying types. For more general information on conditions, visit the [concepts section](overview.mdx#conditions). 



Conditions can be either a single expression, or they can be nested and chained using regular boolean operators, such as `And`, `Or`, or `Not`. 

```rust condition.rs
pub enum Condition {
    And(Vec<Box<Condition>>),
    Or(Vec<Box<Condition>>),
    Not(Box<Condition>),
    Expr(Expr),
}
```




## Expressions

Expressions contain comparisons of popular data types, such as integers, unsigned integers, timestamps, booleans, strings, and more.

```rust condition.rs
pub enum Expr {
    String(GenExpr<Value<String>, StringOp>),
    Uint(GenExpr<NumValue<Uint256, NumExprOp, IntFnOp>, NumOp>),
    Int(GenExpr<NumValue<i128, NumExprOp, IntFnOp>, NumOp>),
    Decimal(GenExpr<NumValue<Decimal256, NumExprOp, DecimalFnOp>, NumOp>),
    Timestamp(TimeExpr),
    BlockHeight(BlockExpr),
    Bool(QueryExpr),
}
```




## Values

A value is the simplest type of input used in an expression. In double-sided [general expressions](#general-expressions), the value can either be a primitive type or a query that gets a primitive type. 

```rust condition.rs
pub enum Value<T> {
    Simple(T),
    Query(QueryExpr),
}

pub enum NumValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp> {
    Simple(T),
    Expr(NumExprValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>),
    Query(QueryExpr),
    Fn(NumFnValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>),
}

pub struct NumExprValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp> {
    pub left: Box<NumValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>>,
    pub op: ExprOp,
    pub right: Box<NumValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>>,
}

pub struct NumFnValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp> {
    pub op: FnOp,
    pub right: Box<NumValue<T, ExprOp, FnOp>>,
}
```

## General expressions



General expressions or _`GenExpr`_ are used to compare two values using a:

- [_`left:`_](focus://2) value, 
- an operator [_`op:`_](focus://3), 
- and a [_`right:`_](focus://4) value. 

The operators of general expressions vary depending on the value type. 

```rust condition.rs
pub struct GenExpr<Type, Op> {
    pub left: Type,
    pub op: Op,
    pub right: Type,
}
```


<Admonition type="tip" icon="âœ…" title="Comparing values">

Only values of the same _`Type`_ can be compared when writing an expression. 

</Admonition>



### String operators

The following operators are used in general expressions when comparing strings. 

```rust condition.rs
#[cw_serde]
pub enum StringOp {
    StartsWith,
    EndsWith,
    Contains,
    Eq,
    Neq,
}
```

### Number operators

The following operators are used in general expressions when comparing integers or decimals. 

```rust condition.rs
#[cw_serde]
pub enum NumOp {
    Eq,
    Neq,
    Lt,
    Gt,
    Gte,
    Lte,
}
```



## Time expressions



Time expressions are like regular unsigned integer expressions, except they only contain a left value and an operator. The right value is filled by a _`BlockHeight`_ or _`Timestamp`_, depending on the value type.

```rust condition.rs
pub struct TimeExpr {
    pub comparator: Uint64,
    pub op: TimeOp, 
}
```



### Time operators

Time operators can be greater than or less than a specified time. 

```rust condition.rs
pub enum TimeOp {
    Lt,
    Gt,
}
```



### Blockheight

Blockheights can be specified as a _`Unit64`_ and a [number operator](#number-operators). 

```rust condition.rs
pub struct BlockExpr {
    pub comparator: Uint64,
    pub op: NumOp,
}
```


## Query expressions



Query expressions are expressions that select a value from a query message. The structure of a _`QueryExpr`_ contains a selector, a query request, and a name. Any [type of query supported by Cosmos](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.QueryRequest.html) can be used in a condition. 

Query expressions can be used as one or both of the values in a [general expression](#general-expressions), or in [boolean expressions](#bool). When query expressions are used in a condition, the JSON of a query message is sent out, and the value specified by the selector string is returned as the value to be compared in the general expression. 

For more information on writing queries and using selectors, visit the [Query page](query.mdx).

```rust condition.rs
pub struct QueryExpr {
    pub selector: String,
    pub query: QueryRequest<String>,
    pub name: String,
}

```

### Bool

Queries can also be written as boolean expressions, in which a [query selector] is evaluated as a boolean.
