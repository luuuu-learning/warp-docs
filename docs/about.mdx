# How it works

## Jobs

Jobs are the backbone of the Warp protocol. Users submit jobs and keepers execute them.

```rust
pub struct Job {
	// unique identifier for each Job
	pub id: Uint64,
	// job creator address
  pub owner: Addr,
	// UTC timestamp for when the job was submitted
  pub publish_time: Uint64,
	// name given to the Job
  pub name: String,
	// status of the job (pending, executed, failed, cancelled)
  pub status: JobStatus,
	// condition set dictating when the Job should be executed
  pub condition: Condition,
	// message to execute when conditions resolve to true
  pub msg: WasmMsg,
	// reward to distribute to the keeper when the Job has been executed
  pub reward: Uint128,
}
```
