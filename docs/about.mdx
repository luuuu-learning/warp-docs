# How it works

The following section is a basic overview of how Warp works. For a more in-depth look at Warp smart contracts, visit the [Contracts](./contracts/README.mdx) section. To learn how to use Warp, visit the tutorial. 

## Jobs

Jobs are the main feature of Warp. Users submit WASM messages along with specified [conditions](#conditions), and a reward. When the conditions are met, [keepers](#keepers) send the message and recieve the reward. 

When a job is created, users must specify a job name, a reward amount, an execute message, and a contract address for the message. The job message is signed by the owner at the time of job creation, to be executed later by keepers. 

Any tokens sent as part of a job's message must be present in the user's [Warp account](#account) balance at the moment of execution.

```rust
pub struct Job {
	// unique identifier for each Job
	pub id: Uint64,
	// job creator address
  pub owner: Addr,
	// UTC timestamp for when the job was submitted
  pub last_update_time: Uint64,
	// name given to the Job
  pub name: String,
	// status of the job (pending, executed, failed, cancelled)
  pub status: JobStatus,
	// condition set dictating when the Job should be executed
  pub condition: Condition,
	// message to execute when conditions resolve to true
  pub msg: Vec<CosmosMsg>,
	// reward to distribute to the keeper when the Job has been executed
  pub reward: Uint128,
}
```

### Conditions

Each job must be submitted with conditions, or a set of circumstances under which the job should be executed. Conditions are made up of expressions which can be simple, such as specifying a blockheight, or complex, in which multiple conditions are nested and joined using boolean operators. Query responses can also be used in expressions to specify a condition. When all the expressions  in a condition evaluate to _`true`_, the condition is met, and the job can be completed. 

To learn more about how conditions work, visit the [Conditions page](./condition.mdx).

### Accounts

In order to transact funds, a job must have access to a wallet. Warp accounts are smart contract wallets that allow users to transact with Warp. Warp accounts function similar to a Cosmos wallet account. For example, users can use their account to send, deposit, delegate, undelegate, or recieve funds. Any transactions using jobs are executed through a user's account. Warp accounts can only be controlled by a user's wallet and the jobs that they create. 

### The queue

Jobs that have been successfully created by a user are added to a queue, where they will remain until their conditions are met and they are executed by a [keeper](#keepers). 

```rust
pub enum JobStatus {
    Pending,
    Executed,
    Failed,
    Cancelled,
}
```

For more on job state, the queue, and a basic workflow, visit the [State page](./contracts/state.mdx).

## Keepers

A keeper is any party that maintains the automation functions of a smart contract. Keepers are incentivized by Warp users to execute smart contract functions on their behalf, in exchange for a reward. Keepers query the chain and evaluate a job's condition. Once the conditions for a job is met, a keeper can submit the execute message contained in the job. 

### Rewards 

The purpose of fees is to increase the reliability of the enitire Warp system. 

## Example

The following illustration demonstrates how a job is executed.
