## Jobs
<CH.Scrollycoding>

### CreateJobMsg

Creates a job using a name, [condition](../how/condition.mdx), execute messages, and a reward. Jobs are stored in an index. Successfully created jobs are given the _`Pending`_ status. Jobs can also contain a _`create_job`_ transactions, allowing jobs to be chained together and executed from the same context. 


```rust Rust
pub struct CreateJobMsg {
    pub name: String,
    pub condition: Condition,
    pub msgs: Vec<String>,
    pub reward: Uint128,
}
```

---

### DeleteJobMsg

Allows the Job owner to delete a pending job. Deleted Job messages are still stored in the index and given a _`Canelled`_ status. 

```rust Rust
pub struct DeleteJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
}
```

---

### UpdateJobMsg

Allows the job owner to update a job. 

```rust Rust
pub struct UpdateJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub condition: Option<Condition>,
    pub added_reward: Option<Uint128>,
}
```

---

### ExecuteJobMsg

Allows a keeper to execute a pending job if the conditions are met. Upon execution of the job, the reward will be released to the keeper. 

```rust Rust
pub struct ExecuteJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
}

```
