<CH.Scrollycoding rows="focus">

## QueryJobMsg

Returns the job information from a given job _`id`_. 

<CH.Code>



```rust Rust-struct
pub struct QueryJobMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
}
```

---

```rust Response
pub struct JobResponse {
    pub job: Job,
}

```

</CH.Code>

---

## QueryJobsMsg

Queries and returns job information based on:

- single or multiple job id's
- Active/inactive jobs
- a job's owner
- a job's name
- a job's status
- jobs specified by a status and a boolean. 
- all job's created after a specific time or blockheight. 

At least one of the previous fields must be specified to return a valid response. 

Response sizes can be limited using _`limit`_. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Rust-struct
pub struct QueryJobsMsg {
    pub ids: Option<Vec<Uint64>>,
    pub active: Option<bool>,
    pub owner: Option<Addr>,
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub job_status: Option<JobStatus>,
    pub condition_status: Option<bool>,
    pub start_after: Option<JobIndex>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
}
```

---

```rust Response
pub struct JobsResponse {
    pub jobs: Vec<Job>,
    pub total_count: usize,
}

```

</CH.Code>

---

## QueryResolve JobConditionMsg

Queries whether a job's condition has been resolved by specifying the job id. Returns a boolean response. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Rust-struct
pub struct QueryResolveJobConditionMsg {
    pub id: Uint64,
}
```

---

```rust Response

    #[returns(bool)]

```


</CH.Code>

---

## QueryResolve ConditionMsg

Queries whether a condition has been resolved by submitting the condition. Returns a boolean response. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Rust-struct
pub struct QueryResolveConditionMsg {
    pub condition: Condition,
}
```

---

```rust Response

    #[returns(bool)]

```


</CH.Code>

---

## SimulateQueryMsg

Simulates a query given a [query request](../how/condition.mdx#queryrequest) message. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Rust-struct
pub struct SimulateQueryMsg {
    pub query: QueryRequest<String>,
}
```

---

```rust Response
pub struct SimulateResponse {
    pub response: String,
}

```

</CH.Code>

---

## QueryAccountMsg

Queries an account by owner. Returns the owner and account addresses. 

<CH.Code>

```rust Rust-struct
pub struct QueryAccountMsg {
    pub owner: String,
}
```

---

```rust Response focus=1:8
pub struct AccountResponse {
    pub account: Account,
}

pub struct Account {
    pub owner: Addr,
    pub account: Addr,
}
```


</CH.Code>

---

## QueryAccountsMsg

Queries accounts. Response sizes can be limited using _`limit`_. 


<CH.Code>

```rust Rust-struct
pub struct QueryAccountsMsg {
    pub start_after: Option<String>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
}
```

---

```rust Response
pub struct AccountsResponse {
    pub accounts: Vec<Account>,
}

pub struct Account {
    pub owner: Addr,
    pub account: Addr,
}
```


</CH.Code>

---

## QueryAccountsMsg

Queries the config.

<CH.Code>
